I chose the above course to give myself a better grounding in, and wider understanding of, UK election law and how it interacts with the Human Rights Act 1998. 

Particular areas of concern raised in the course included the continuing disenfranchisement of prisoners for reasons of "penal populism" rather than for any coherent policy reasoning. 

My critical essay evaluated the extent of electoral fraud in the UK. I achieved a First Class Honours grade for both this essay and the course as a whole.
