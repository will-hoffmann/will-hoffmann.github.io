This course allowed me to develop my interest in the American Constitution whilst giving me a stronger foundation in the different approaches of Western constitutionalism. 
My critical essay “How do different legal systems strike the balance between freedom of speech and privacy?” examined the diversity in the US and UK treatment of the right to freedom of speech with the right to privacy. 
I achieved a First Class Honours grade for this essay.
